This is a fork of [JMSSerializer](https://github.com/schmittjoh/serializer), aimed at supporting nested serialize calls.

Learn more about it here: https://github.com/schmittjoh/serializer/issues/319

This fork is not actively maintained, we have open [PR](https://github.com/schmittjoh/serializer/pull/341), 
and it look like this feature is not intended to be supported on the core lib.

It works for us. Use it at your own risks.
